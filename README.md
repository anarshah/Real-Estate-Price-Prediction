# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Predicting house prices using machine learning: A web application built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

# Real Estate Price Prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of real estate properties in Islamabad, Pakistan. The project uses a dataset of properties in Islamabad, along with their features such as location, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need Python 3.7 or later, along with the following Python libraries:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost

You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

This will start a web server and open the project in your default web browser. From there, you can select the problem you want to solve (classification or regression), and input the features of a property to get a price prediction.

# Data
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Zameen.com, a real estate portal in Pakistan. The dataset contains information about properties in Islamabad, including their location, price, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc.
